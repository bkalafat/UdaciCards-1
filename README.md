# UdaciCards
This project is developed for Udacity React Nanodegree (React Native) project submission.

The basic idea of the project is to create bunch of decks each with few cards. Each card will contain question and answer. the users can later come back and test themselves and evaluate themselves by checking if the answer is right.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

## How To Install And Run The App

1. Clone/Download this repo and then do `yarn install` in the root of this project from the command terminal

2. you should see a barcode with bunch of options, type `i` for iphone simulator ( Tested only in iOS simulator)

You are all set, this app is now running in your iOS simulator.
